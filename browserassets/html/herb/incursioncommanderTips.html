	<p>Oh, hi Merlin!</p>

	<p>On the table in front of you are a set of <em>Fireteam Designators</em>, which allows you to split up your squad into smaller fireteams with their own radio channels. Your headset will be able to listen to all fireteam channels in addition to the general Syndicate channel.</p>

	<p>Since you are the commander, you start with an extra piece of gear, a <em>Syndicate QuikDrop beacon</em>, which allows you to click on a storage crate to store its location. Using it in-hand will send a Syndicate drop pod to your co-ordinates containing that crate. The beacon only has one use, so use it sparingly!</p>

	<p>Additionally, your task force starts with a set of four <em>body cameras</em> which can be worn in the accessory slot. When turned on, you can view the live feed from each using a <em>Syndicate</em> (and specifically Syndicate!) camera monitor or computer. You can tell if your monitoring device is the right one if the description says it's connected to the ALTAI network.</p>
