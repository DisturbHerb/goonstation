	<p>Oh, hi Merlin!</p>

	<p>Since you are the commander, you start with an extra piece of gear, a <em>Fireteam Designator</em>, which allows you to split up your squad into smaller fireteams with their own radio channels. Your headset will be able to listen to all fireteam channels in addition to the general Syndicate channel.</p>

	<p>Additionally, your task force starts with a set of four <em>body cameras</em> which can be worn in the accessory slot. When turned on, you can view the live feed from each using a <em>Syndicate</em> (and specifically Syndicate!) camera monitor or computer. You can tell if your monitoring device is the right one if the description says it's connected to the ALTAI network.</p>
